# Waiter_Tips_Prediction_Machine_Learning


## Waiter Tips Prediction

This repository contains a Python script that performs data analysis and builds a machine learning model to predict tips for waiters based on various factors such as the total bill, gender, smoking status, day of the week, time of day, and party size.

### Overview:

- **Data Analysis**:
  - The script starts by importing necessary libraries including pandas, numpy, and Plotly for data manipulation, numerical computations, and interactive visualizations respectively.
  - A CSV file named "tips.csv" is read into a pandas DataFrame to analyze the dataset.
  - The first 5 rows of the dataset are displayed to provide a preview of the data structure and content.

- **Data Visualization**:
  - Multiple scatter plots and pie charts are created using Plotly Express to visualize relationships and distributions among different variables in the dataset.
  - Scatter plots visualize relationships between the total bill, tip amount, and other factors such as gender, day of the week, and time of day.
  - Pie charts display the distribution of tip amounts across different categories such as gender, smoking status, day of the week, and time of day.

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Categorical variables in the dataset such as gender, smoking status, day of the week, and time of day are encoded using label encoding to convert them into numerical format suitable for machine learning models.

- **Machine Learning Model**:
  - A linear regression model is built using scikit-learn to predict tip amounts based on the features including the total bill, gender, smoking status, day of the week, time of day, and party size.
  - The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split with a test size of 20% and a random state of 42.
  - The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set to measure its performance in predicting tip amounts.

### How to Use:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the directory containing the Python script.
2. Install the required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` (assuming a requirements.txt file is present with necessary library dependencies).
3. Run the Python script to execute the data analysis, visualization, and machine learning model building processes.
4. Modify the features array with desired input values to predict tip amounts for specific scenarios using the trained model.

### Files Included:

- `tips.csv`: Dataset containing information about total bills, tip amounts, and other factors influencing tipping behavior.
- `waiter_tips_prediction.py`: Python script containing code for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning model building.
